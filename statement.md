# Student Record Management System – Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Managing student records manually often leads to errors, misplaced information, and difficulty in retrieving or updating data.  
Common issues include:

- Incorrect or inconsistent entries  
- Time-consuming searches  
- Missing or duplicate records  
- Lack of proper organization  

To address these challenges, a simple command-line Student Record Management System is developed using Python. It stores student information in a nested dictionary structure, allowing quick and organized access to records. The system supports essential operations such as adding, searching, editing, and deleting student details.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is limited to building a small-scale, menu-driven student record system that:

- Runs entirely in the command line  
- Stores multiple student records in memory using nested dictionaries  
- Handles basic CRUD operations  
- Uses a modular program structure with separate functions for each operation  
- Works without external files, databases, or third-party libraries  

This project focuses on fundamental programming concepts rather than large-scale data handling or graphical interfaces.

## Target Users
The system is primarily designed for:

1. Beginners learning Python programming  
2. Students in schools or colleges working on basic projects  
3. Educators who need simple examples to teach data structures  
4. Anyone practicing menu-driven programs or nested dictionary usage  

## High-Level Features
The main features included in the system are:

- Add new student records  
- Search for a student using a registration number  
- Update existing student details  
- Delete a student record  
- Display all stored student records in a structured format  
- Maintain data in a nested dictionary for efficient access  
- Simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation
